===================================Q1===================================
The PID namespace provides processes with an independentset of
process IDs (PIDs) from other namespaces.The first process created
in a PID namespace is assigned the process id number 1 and receives
most of the same special treatment as the normal init process gets.
If you want to run identical copy of a piece of software its not always
possible to do at the same time. if you isolate the PID so that it is
not aware of what is going on outside of it own processes, you could run
the both together.

===================================Q2===================================
Creating a separate mount namespace allows each of these isolated
processes to have a completely different view of the entire systems
mountpoint structure from the original one. This allows you to have
a different root for each isolated process, as well as other mountpoints
that are specific to those processes.

===================================Q3===================================
You can use cgoups to limit what a container can do. One example is 
you can use cgroups to limit the maximal number of processes of the
countainer. Another use it you can limit containers maximal usage
of memory or maximal usage of CPU.

===================================Q4===================================
We use clone command to create a new child process.
The diffrence between fork to clone is that when we use clone 
we provide more precise control over the data shared between the
parent and child processes. 
clone offers more control on data shared between the process we creat.

===================================Q5===================================
The chroot command changes the root directory of the currently running 
processes as well as its child processes.

===================================Q6===================================
The procfs is virtual file system that presents information about the processes that are currently running.
The procfs creates when the system boots and disappear when it shuts down.
One usage of it is for communication between kernel space and user space.
